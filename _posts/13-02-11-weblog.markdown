title: NetFPGA Senior Project Update
---

What I accomplished today:

* Learned how to calculate Network performance given different conditions.
* Read about the TCP protocol and how it implements the Sliding Window Protocol.
* Learned about CRC and other types of basic error detection/correction in Framing Protocols.
* Worked on my Senior Project with the NetFPGA

    * Finished installing Xilinx ISE updates and started playing around with the reference projects more.
    * Familiarizing myself with the workflow of a NetFPGA project.

TODO:
* Learn how to use Xilinx ISE with IP pack to generate bitfiles from verilog projects with the NetFPGA. -- Talk to Jake or Dr. Kredo on this
* Compile and Implement my own bitfile.

    * This might not be that hard if everything is the same as [here](http://wiki.netfpga.org/foswiki/bin/view/NetFPGA/OneGig/VerifyHardwareAndSoftware#Run_regression_scripts_on_new_bi)

* Get ModelSim somehow
