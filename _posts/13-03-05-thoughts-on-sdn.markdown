title: Thoughts on SDN

1. The network should work for you.  Not the other way around.
2. You should be able to deploy the hardware and let the network communicate with applications to work things out.
3. The network should be intelligent, providing feedback to the user about network health.
4. The only thing the user should have to worry about are the hosts at the endpoints, not the stuff in between.
5. The network should be programmable, scalable and fault-tolerant.
